# Lock-Free Stack

A Lock-Free Stack implementation using Java's Atomics library. This stack uses
AtomicInteger and AtomicReference in place of mutexes.

## Atomic vs. Volatile
The use of atomic, volatile, or both types were considered to make this stack lock free. Atomic variables are able to do operations instantaneously, while volatile types ensure that all threads are reading the most up-to-date copy of a variable. However, volatile variables are not by default atomic.

This implementation uses atomic types over volatiles because Java's Atomics library offers an atomic compare and set. By comparing the nodes in the stack, whether it be during a push or a pop, and being able to swap them at the correct time in one atomic instruction, the operation will only proceed if it sees a head pointer it is expecting. The `compareAndSet()`checks the current head of the stack and compares it with the expected head node, and if it is indeed the same (meaning no other thread had modified the stack), it will 'swap' the nodes respective to the type of instruction (push or pop).

If the stack did not use atomics or volatiles, different threads could read different values from the stack and execute their code based on a false-positive. It could also do node swaps while another thread is swapping, and have the stack corrupted.

## Linearizability
The linearizability of this lock-free stack depends on the atomic variables within it. Since the stack uses an atomic `compareAndSet()` (an \*instantaneous operation) before switching nodes, if another thread modifies the same memory location the current thread is handling, the method call is guaranteed to fail. Therefore, its execution is not interrupted halfway and it does not produce ambiguous results. The shared objects in the stack are accessed \*instantaneously, so its linearizability is proven by having the operations complete in a reasonable and expected manner. Furthermore, since the stack completes its operations in a predictable manner, it satisfies linearizability's non-blocking property. By not having unexpected delays (thanks to atomics!), some thread `x` does not block another thread `y` from making progress.

\*seemingly instantaneous *enough*, since things are not *actually* done instantaneously in the computer ;)

## Structure

This stack has two separate files: `LockFreeStack.java` and `LockFreeStackRunner.java`.

`LockFreeStack.java` includes a basic `Node` class that takes in a generic type `T` and
the `LockFreeStack` class, which also holds generic types.

The `LockFreeStackRunner.java` bears lots of goodies! It includes a `LockFreeRunnable` that implements `Runnable` with a custom `run()` method that randomizes between push and pop operations on the `LockFreeStack` that holds random integers. With each operation, a print statement is outputted with failure/success notices and the time the operation took place.
The stack's contents is also printed at the end of all the thread executions, along with
the runtime in milliseconds.

Use the following to run the program:
```
$ javac LockFreeStack.java LockFreeStackRunner.java
$ java LockFreeStackRunner
```
And expect an output similar to this example:
```
-> Thread 6 failed call to pop() at 1518042632105ms.
-> Thread 4 failed call to pop() at 1518042632105ms.
-> Thread 5 failed call to pop() at 1518042632105ms.
-> Thread 2 pushed 236 at 1518042632105ms.
-> Thread 0 pushed 130 at 1518042632105ms.
-> Thread 1 pushed 131 at 1518042632105ms.
-> Thread 3 pushed 268 at 1518042632105ms.
-> Thread 7 popped 131 at 1518042632105ms.
-> Thread 8 popped 268 at 1518042632106ms.
-> Thread 9 popped 130 at 1518042632107ms.
-> Stack contents:
236
Runtime: 4ms.
```
## Comparisons
The transition from lock based to lock free proved to show heavily improved success rates.
Although the execution time bumped up with the lock free implementation, it was only by less than a handful of milliseconds.

In an run with 10 threads, a push/pop operation on a lock based stack had the following stats:
```
push() -> ~4ms execution, 30% success rate
pop() -> ~3ms execution, 70% success rate
```

In the same run with the lock free stack, the statistics came out as follows:
```
push() -> ~5.4ms execution, 100% success rate
pop() -> ~6.4ms execution, 100% success rate
```

\*The above `pop()` operations were made consecutively on a stack pre-loaded with
enough nodes to pop off.

###Notes
A bank of pre-made nodes was used for this implementation to avoid chances of memory
protection occurrences. An ArrayList is made with MAX_NUM_NODES (initially at 1000) nodes with `null` values. The stack's `push()` operation will grab an allocated
node from the ArrayList and set it's value to the value passed into the call to push.
